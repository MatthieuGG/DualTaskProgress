# Dual Task Progress (DTP)

**Input: individual or collective .csv files ([~/sample]())  
Output: individual or collective .csv files, as well as a collective plot ([~/results]())  
Script: [DualTaskProgress.ipynb]()**  

Automatically calculates the cognitive-motor dual-task effect (DTE) and the dual-task progress (DTP) from the cognitive and motor performances of subjects at 2 times (T1 and T2), both realised in single and dual task condition (ST and DT).  

To do so, you need to:
- transpose your participants performance into .csv files (see exemples of files structures in [~/sample]())
- use the provided code [DualTaskProgress.ipynb]() on your files to obtain the DTE and DTP scores and appreciation, as well as a graphical representation (see [~/results]()). You can run the code as is if you keep the same path.
